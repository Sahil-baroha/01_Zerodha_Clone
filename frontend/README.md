# Zerodha Clone  

## 📌 Description

This is a learning-based project — a clone of [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com/) built to understand how frontend and backend work together in a trading platform. Features include real-time prices, basic analytics, and UI similar to Zerodha.

I'm documenting the structure and process to help myself stay organized and avoid forgetting how things were built.
